# OpenX4 E-Paper Community SDK

A **community-maintained SDK** for building firmware and tools for the **Xteink X4** device. This repository is designed to be included as a **Git submodule** inside PlatformIO projects, providing a shared set of libraries, utilities, and development workflows that make working with the X4 simple and consistent.

## ✨ **What is this?**

The **OpenX4 E-Paper Community SDK** provides:

- **Common PlatformIO-friendly components** for the Xteink X4

- **Reusable libraries** for display control, graphics, hardware helpers, utilities, etc.

- **Tools** to support flashing, packaging, testing, and device workflows

- A central place for **community contributions**, improvements, and shared knowledge

The SDK is intentionally modular - bring it into your project and use only what you need.

│   ├── graphics/      # Drawing, fonts, UI utilities
│   ├── hardware/      # GPIO, power, sensors, timings, etc.

    ├── assets/        # Conversion tools for images/fonts
    └── ...            # Community-contributed utilities
```

Each lib aims to be **self-contained**, **documented**, and **PlatformIO-friendly**. Libs should be categorized under `libs/` based on functionality, and then contained within a directory under that root.

## 📦 Adding to Your PlatformIO Project

Add this repository as a submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/open-x4-epaper/community-sdk.git open-x4-sdk
```

Then add each lib you need into your `platformio.ini` file as `lib_deps`:

```
lib_deps =
  BatteryMonitor=symlink://open-x4-sdk/libs/hardware/BatteryMonitor
  EpdScreenController=symlink://open-x4-sdk/libs/display/EpdScreenController
```

Then you can include the libraries in your project as usual:

```
#include <BatteryMonitor.h>
#include <EpdScreenController.h>
```

Or load tools from the `tools/` directory as needed.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a **community-driven project** - contributions are not only welcome but encouraged!

Ways you can help:

- Improve or extend existing libraries

- Add new modules to `libs/`

- Build utilities for the `tools/` directory

- Report issues, propose features, or help refine the API

- Improve documentation

### Contribution guidelines (short version)

1. Keep modules self-contained

2. Prefer zero-dependency solutions where practical

3. Document your additions

4. Use clear naming and consistent structure

5. Be friendly and constructive in PR conversations

A full contributing guide will be added as the project grows.
